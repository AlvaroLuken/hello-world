# hello-world
Just learning the essentials of Github. Excited to become a great engineer!
My name is Alvaro Luken. I am a Freshman at New York University. I love technology and the places we can go if we construct and develop responsibly and for the betterment of the commonwealth. I am majoring in Computer Science and working on the track to acquire a minor in Political Science. Who would have thought that this chico from Tijuana would make it to New York City, huh?
